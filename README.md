## Lab № 2 "Array-based & Singly Linked Circular List App"

## Description

This project implements a custom list data structure according to the given variant. The application includes methods for list operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and cloning. Additionally, unit tests are provided to ensure the correctness of the implementation, and a Continuous Integration (CI) system is set up to automatically run tests on each commit.

## Variant Calculation
The variant is determined by the remainder of the division of the student ID number (my ID = 3222)  by 4:
```txt
  3222 / 4 = 805 (rem. 2) -> Variant №2
```
### Variant №2:
- Initial list implementation: list based on built-in arrays/lists
- Second list implementation: singly linked circular list

## Build and Run Instructions

### Requirements

- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or newer)
- Installed Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/kytaets/Soft-Dev-Methodologies-Lab-2.git

## Conclusion
This project helped me see the importance of unit testing and CI. Writing tests made debugging easier and increased my confidence in the code. Setting up CI automated the testing process, ensuring code quality. Overall, I now understand why these practices are essential in software development.
